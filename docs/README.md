# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This directory contains all the processes, guidelines, and best practices for managing projects at OctoAcme.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes:
- **Customer-first delivery**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative increments**: Delivering small, testable features with continuous feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Defined roles and responsibilities for every project
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Fostering a culture of feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

Our project management processes are designed to help cross-functional teams deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining high quality standards and clear stakeholder communication.

## Core Roles and Responsibilities

Understanding who does what is critical to project success. OctoAcme projects typically involve:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, direction, and approvals

For detailed persona descriptions and communication patterns, see [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem, identify stakeholders, and establish a high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break down work into actionable tasks, estimate effort, and create release plans
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate in sprints or iterations
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and communicate to users
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, celebrate successes, and identify improvements

Each phase has specific deliverables, decision gates, and quality criteria documented in the process guides below.

## Process Documentation

### Getting Started

New to OctoAcme project management? Start here:

1. **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** - Read this first for a high-level introduction to our approach, principles, and key artifacts
2. **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** - Understand the responsibilities and communication patterns for each role

### Project Lifecycle Guides

Follow these guides sequentially as you move through a project:

- **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** - Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager with success criteria
- **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** - Turn approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with timelines, dependencies, and risk management
- **[Execution and Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** - Manage sprint activities, track progress, and maintain team velocity
- **[Risks and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** - Identify and mitigate risks while keeping stakeholders informed
- **[Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** - Plan and execute production releases with proper validation and rollback strategies
- **[Retrospective and Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** - Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams create and maintain these artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, and stakeholders
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: High-level timeline with milestones and dependencies
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Quality criteria that must be met before work is considered complete
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks with impact, probability, and mitigation strategies
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items from each sprint or milestone

## Communication Cadence

Consistent communication keeps projects on track:

- **Weekly sync** between PM and PdM to align on priorities and blockers
- **Twice-weekly standups** for the delivery team (or as agreed based on project needs)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** to share progress, risks, and upcoming milestones
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed for urgent issues or decision-making
